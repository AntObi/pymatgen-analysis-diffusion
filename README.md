# Pymatgen-diffusion

This is an add-on to pymatgen for diffusion analysis that is developed
by the Materials Virtual Lab. Note that it relies on pymatgen for structural 
manipulations, file io, and preliminary analyses. In particular, pymatgen's 
DiffusionAnalyzer is used heavily. The purpose of this add-on
is to provide other diffusion analyses, using trajectories extracted using the
DiffusionAnalyzer class. 

This is, and will always be, a scientific work in progress. Pls check back 
for more details.

# Features (non-exhaustive!)

1. Van-Hove analysis
2. Probability density
3. Clustering (e.g., k-means with periodic boundary conditions).

# Citing
